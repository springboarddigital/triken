									Triken Today’s Cuts is meat cut and delivered the<br> same day. Freshly and hygienically. 
								</h2>
								<p class=" mx-auto text-center">Every day is as fresh as a daisy to start with. This philosophy not only applies to life, but also to the necessity to consume fresh food every day. That said, everyone deserves to get delivered with fresh meat that is cut, cleaned, and packed the same day.</p>

								<p class=" mx-auto text-center">Today’s Cuts isn’t just a brand name, but a commitment that we have made ourselves to offer fresh meat products that are cut, cleaned and delivered the same day of procurement. Today’s Cuts is an evolution of Triken™, a reputed name that revolutionized free-range country chicken meat in South India.</p>

								<p class=" mx-auto text-center">With a wide range of meats and seafood to choose from—at your convenience—Triken Today’s Cuts makes your love of meat complete.

                                                We keep up our authenticity not just in offering fresh meat, but also in procuring it from reliable resources. Chickens that are free-range and broiler are procured from poultry farms of South Indian villages. We get our fish from various shores along the Arabian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the fresh waters of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Our mutton comes from natively-raised goats from the farmlands of Tamil Nadu.
